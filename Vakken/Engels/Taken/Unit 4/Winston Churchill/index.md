## Winston Churchill

Hello, everyone.
Today I am going to talk about Winston Churchill.

Winston Churchill, who is born on November 30th, 1874, in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, was a very complicated person.

He was strong, brave, a winner, a good talker and very odd. His iconic image, almost  every time with a cigar, shows that he was a person of his own rules.

Churchill didn’t like school, the only subjects that he liked were History and Literature, that’s why he had been sent to the army by his father.

Churchill’s connection to the Freemasons is very important. He joined Studholme Lodge No. 1591 and became a Master Mason. His family already had a history within the Freemasons, it was a tradition he continued in his family.
In 1953, Churchill had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Churchill was most known as Prime Minister during World War II. He guided his country through when it needed him. 

He was a man who enjoyed life, Churchill consumed 8 to 10 cigars a day. He passed away on January 24th, 1965, after a second stroke.
